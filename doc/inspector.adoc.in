== NAME

inspector - convert C-DNS query/response info to PCAP or text

== SYNOPSIS

*inspector* ['OPTIONS']... ['FILE'...]

== DESCRIPTION

*inspector* reads C-DNS query/response files produced by *compactor* and
writes output files using one of two output formats. Optionally, IP addresses may be
pseudo-anonymised.

By default, *inspector* writes output using PCAP. This generates
reconstructed traffic for the query/responses in the C-DNS file.

Alternatively, *inspector* can use a templated text output. This generates output
based on a text template which specifies the output to be produced for each
query/response record.

*inspector* also writes a `.info` file for each output data file written. This is a plain
text file, named as the output file but with `.info` appended. It contains
a configuration and statistics summary for the capture.

If no input file is given, *inspector* reads its standard input. In this case, an
output file must be specified with the *--output* option.

== OPTIONS

=== Generic Program Information

*-h, --help*::
  Print a usage message briefly summarising these command-line options and then exit.

*-v, --version*::
  Print the version number of *inspector* to the standard output stream and then exit.

*--defaultsfile* [_arg_]::
  Specify the path to the default_values.conf file. If not specified, the
  default configuration file `@ETCPATH@/default_values.conf` is read if present.

=== Outputs

*-o, --output* _FILENAME_::
  Write a single output file named _FILENAME_ containing output
  generated from all the input files specified. If no output filename
  is specified, an output file is written for each input file
  named as the input file with `.pcap` or `.txt` appended to the name. In either
  case, if the file already exists, a counter is appended to the
  filename (e.g. `-1`) until a filename is generated that does not
  exist. If _FILENAME_ is `-`, output is written to standard output.
  In this case, no info (configuration and statistics summary) is generated.

*-F, --output-format* _FORMAT_::
  Write output using the nominated _FORMAT_. This must be either
  `pcap` or `template`. If not specified, `pcap` is the default.

*-z, --gzip-output* [_arg_]::
  Compress data in the output files using gzip(1) format. _arg_ may be
  `true` or `1` to  enable compression, `false` or `0` to disable compression.
  If _arg_ is omitted,  it defaults to `true`. If compression is enabled, an
  extension `.gz` is added to  the output filename.

*-y, --gzip-level* [_arg_]::
  Compression level to use when producing gzip(1) output. _arg_ must be
  a single digit `0` to `9`.  If not specified, the default level is `6`.

*-x, --xz-output* [_arg_]::
  Compress data in the output files using xz(1) format. _arg_ may be `true`
  or `1` to enable compression, `false` or `0` to disable compression. If _arg_ is omitted,
  it defaults to `true`. If compression is enabled, an extension `.xz` is added to
  the output filename.

*-u, --xz-preset* [_arg_]::
  Compression preset level to use when producing xz(1) output. _arg_ must be
  a single digit `0` to `9`.  If not specified, the default level is `6`.

*-r. --report-info*::
  Report info (config and statistics summary) to standard output on exit.

*-N, --no-output*::
  Don't write any output PCAP or template files, just generate any requested ancillary
  outputs e.g. `.info` files.

*-O, --no-info*::
  Don't write any `.info` files.

*-X, --excludesfile*::
  For each input, write a `.excludesfile` file. This is in the format of an
  exclude hints file as specified to _compactor_ and indicates which data fields in
  the input file were not collected.

*-S, --stats*::
  For each input file, write the number of query/response records converted and the time
  taken to standard error  on completion.

*-k, --pseudo-anonymisation-key*::
   Key to use during output pseudo-anonymisation. Must be 16 bytes long.

*-P, --pseudo-anonymisation-passphrase*::
   Passphrase to use to generate key for output pseudo-anonymisation.

*-p, --pseudo-anonymise*::
   Pseudo-anonymise output.

*--debug-qr*::
   Print a summary of each query/response pair to standard output on reading
   from the input C-DNS file.

=== PCAP-specific options

*-q, --query-only*::
  Write only query messages to the output.

=== Template-specific options

*-t, --template* _FILENAME_::
  Write output based on the template in the file named _FILENAME_.

*-v, --value* _NAME=TEXT_::
  Set a value named _NAME_ with value _TEXT_ on the command line. This value
  can be used in the template. This parameter may be repeated multiple times
  to specify different values.

*-g, --geoip-db-dir* _DIR_::
  `inspector` can present geographic  IP data in the output. This requires
  the MaxMind GeoLite2 database files, which
  should be found in directory _DIR_.  If not specified, the
  default directory `@VARLIBPATH@/GeoIP` is checked. *inspector* needs
  files _GeoLite2-ASN.mmdb_ and _GeoLite2-City.mmdb_ to be present to enable
  geographic IP data in the output.

== TEMPLATE FILES

A template file describes the output generated by *inspector* for each
query/response item in a C-DNS file.

=== Template markers

When output for each query/response item
is generated, elements, or markers, like `{{NAME}}` in the template are replaced
with a data item named `NAME` from the query/response (QR) item.

If the data item isn't available in the query/response item, nothing is output for
the marker. For example, "QTYPE `{{query_type}}`" will output "QTYPE 1"
for a query with a question of type of QTYPE A, and will output "QTYPE " if there
is no query question.

=== Template section

A template may optionally contain a section start marker
`{{#QUERY_RESPONSE_HEADER}}` and a section end marker
`{{/QUERY_RESPONSE_HEADER}}`. If present, text between these markers
is output before the first query/response output record.

=== Template marker modifiers

A marker modifier is a filter that is applied at template expansion time and modifies
the value of the marker before it is output. Modifiers are specified by following the
marker name with a colon and the modifier name,
e.g. `{{client_address:x-ipaddr}}`.

| Output input data escaping for use with CSV as described in https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4180[RFC4180], e.g. `"Hello, ""quotes"""`.

| `x-hexstring`
| Output binary input data as hex characters. A 0 byte is output as `\0`, all other values as `\xaa`.

| `x-ipaddr`
| Output text representation of a IPv4 or IPv6 address, depending on whether  filter input was 4 or 16 bytes.

| `x-ip6addr`
| Output IPv4 or IPv6 address as the IPv6 printable address representation. IPv4  addresses are output as `::ffff:192.0.2.25`.

| Given an IPv4 or IPv6 address, output the ASN reported by the MaxMind database for that address, or 0 if not found. Error if no MaxMind database files are found.

| `x-ipaddr-geo-as-netmask`
| Given an IPv4 or IPv6 address, output the netmask reported by the MaxMind database for the AS network containing that address, or 0 if not found. Error if no MaxMind database files are found.

| Output timestamp in seconds as a UTC date in ISO601 format (YYYY-MM-DD).

| `x-datefmt=<fmt>`

| Output timestamp in seconds as a UTC date and time in ISO601 format (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS).

|===

Other predefined modifiers designed for use with HTML output are available.
See the documentation for the `ctemplate` library at
https://github.com/OlafvdSpek/ctemplate.

== EXIT STATUS

The exit status is 1 if any error occurred. A successful run ends with an exit status of 0.

== LIMITATIONS

The design of C-DNS allows blocks with different storage and collection parameters
to be present in the same C-DNS file. This might arise when two separate C-DNS
files are merged.

At the time of writing, no tool exists to do this. *inspector* has not been tested on
such inputs, and may not exhibit correct behaviour if presented with such a file.
