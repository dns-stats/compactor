== Installation

=== Installing from packages

Binary install packages are available from a
https://launchpad.net[Launchpad] PPA (Personal Package Archive)
`ppa:dns-stats/compactor-bionic` for

* http://releases.ubuntu.com/18.04/[Ubuntu 18.04 LTS 'Bionic Beaver']

Experimental packages for Ubuntu 20.04 are also available for early testing
from `ppa:dns-stats/compactor-focal`.

==== Ubuntu packages

_compactor_ and  _inspector_  are supplied in separate packages named
`dns-stats-compactor` and `dns-stats-inspector`.

[[libtins]]
===== Pre-requisites

Both _compactor_ and _inspector_ use
https://libtins.github.io/[libtins] for various network related
functions. There is no suitable pre-packaged version for Ubuntu Xenial, so
a package is supplied along with the DNS-STATS packages. It will be installed
as a pre-requisite package automatically.

===== Installing

You need first to add the DNS-STATS PPA to your system's Software Sources:

----
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:dns-stats/compactor
sudo apt update
----

You can then install either both of the `dns-stats-compactor` or
`dns-stats-inspector` packages. Their pre-requisite packages will be
downloaded and installed automatically.

----
$ sudo apt install dns-stats-compactor
$ sudo apt install dns-stats-inspector
----

===== Post-installation

[TIP]
====
After installation _compactor_ can be used <<running.adoc#command-line,from the
command line>>, for example for ad-hoc captures or converting PCAP
capture files.
====

Whenever the _compactor_ package is installed, the system will attempt
to start _compactor_ as a service.

The first time the _compactor_ package is installed, it installs a
default configuration file `@ETCPATH@/compactor.conf`. This
default configuration does not specify a capture interface, so the
attempt at starting _compactor_ as a service will fail.  Before
using _compactor_ as a service, you need to edit the default
configuration and at minimum specify a capture interface.

When the _compactor_ package is upgraded, any running service is
stopped for the upgrade and restarted immediately the upgrade is
complete.

=== Installing from source

The source code is available at: https://github.com/dns-stats/compactor

Release tarballs are also available on github. 

==== Pre-requisites

To build _compactor_ and _inspector_ from source, the following items
are required.  They should be available via standard installation repositories
for most platforms. If not, for information on building pre-requisite items from
source, see the documentation for those items.

[cols=".^,.^",frame=none,grid=none]
|===

| `{cpp} compiler` | _compactor_ and _inspector_ are written in
  {cpp}. Building them requires a {cpp} compiler and tool chain compatible
  with the 2011 ISO standard, otherwise {cpp}11.

| `pkg-config` | Used for dependency management.

| `boost-log`
.5+| Several libraries from http://www.boost.org[Boost
  {cpp}] are required. Depending on your system, it may be possible to
  install just the build requirements for individual libraries, or it
  may be more convenient to install all the Boost libraries.
  NOTE: _compactor_ and _inspector_ require Boost 1.54 or later.

| `boost-program-options`

| `boost-system`

| `boost-thread`

| `boost-iostreams`

| `boost-filesystem` |

| `liblzma`| The compression library from http://tukaani.org/xz/[XZ utils].

| `libpcap`| Library for capturing network traffic http://www.tcpdump.org/.

| `libtcmalloc-minimal4`| Optionally, on systems such as Linux where
  it's available, `tcmalloc` from the
  http://goog-perftools.sourceforge.net/doc/tcmalloc.html[Google
  performance tools] gives a notable performance boost over standard
  `glibc` `malloc`. If not present, the build will use the standard
  system `malloc`.

| `libtins` | Networking functions library. http://libtins.github.io/.
See  <<libtins>> if there is no package for your OS.

| `openssl` | Cryptography library, used in pseudo-anonymisation.
http://www.openssl.org/.

| `libctemplate` | Text templating system. https://github.com/OlafvdSpek/ctemplate.

| `libmaxminddb` | MaxMind GeoIP reader. https://github.com/maxmind/libmaxminddb.
|===

==== Optionally building documentation

The documentation is built using http://asciidoctor.org/[Asciidoctor], version 1.5.0 or later is required (this may
require installation using 'gem install asciidoctor' on some platforms).

http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/[Doxygen] documentation is also built if Doxygen is installed.

==== Building and installing

==== Building from a git repository

To build _compactor_ and _inspector_, select the desired branch; for example the
most recent release branch/tag or the latest development code which is in 'develop'.

----
$ git checkout <branch or tag>
$ git submodule update --init
----

The code uses https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Build_System[GNU Autotools].
Building and installing requires configuring for the locally installed version
of Autotool, and then follows the usual Autotools process.

----
$ ./autogen.sh
$ ./configure
$ make
$ make install
----

As usual with Autotools, by default the install is to directories under `/usr/local`.

==== Building from a release tarball

To build _compactor_ and _inspector_, unpack the release tarball.

----
$ tar -xvzf dns-stats-compactor-<version>.tar.gz
----

The code uses https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Build_System[GNU Autotools].
Building and installing follows the usual Autotools process.

----
$ cd dns-stats-compactor-<version>
$ ./configure
$ make
$ make install
----

As usual with Autotools, by default the install is to directories under `/usr/local`.
