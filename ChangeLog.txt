Version 1.2.2 - 2022-07-11
--------------------------

* Minor documentation updates

Version 1.2.2-rc1 - 2022-05-24
--------------------------

* Extend SIGUSR1 mechanism to DNSTAP capture
* Align DNSTAP stats logging better with network capture stats logging
* Various minor updates to documentation

Version 1.2.2-beta1 - 2022-05-18
--------------------------

* Provide a mechanism to force a C-DNS file rollover via a SIGUSR1 signal to 
  compactor. See KNOWN ISSUES for more info on file rollover issues. This change
  does not effect PCAP file rollovers. NOTE: this can result in a C-DNS file 
  containing no DNS messages being produced.
* Update Catch from 2.13.2 to 2.13.9 (Thanks LeSuisse)

Version 1.2.1 - 2022-03-23
--------------------------

* Minor documentation update to address 
  https://github.com/dns-stats/compactor/issues/80

Version 1.2.1-rc2 - 2022-01-26
--------------------------

* The behaviour of `compactor` is changed when an interrupt (SIGINT, SIGTERM)
  is received e.g. when the service is restarted or a user enters ^C.
  Previously all of the in progress C-DNS compression was aborted and all of
  the in progress output files (compressed and uncompressed) were removed. Now
  the `.raw` uncompressed output file is left on disk so it can be manually
  recovered (i.e. renamed and compressed). Users will now need to choose how to
  managed these uncompressed files. Behaviour on SIGHUP (re-reading of config
  file without affecting any in progress compression) is unchanged.
* Additional default logging is added of the specific signal received by
  `compactor`, when file rotation occurs and when compression is aborted.
* New `log-file-handing` option to log low level details of file
  processing on file rotation and compression. This aids with debugging of file
  processing problems and measurement of C-DNS file compression times.
* Text added in the documentation to clarify time patterns are needed in file
  output patterns for filename based file rotation to occur (based on the
  `rotation-period` option).
* Fix a bug relating to `compactor` start_time handling introduced in rc1.

Version 1.2.1-rc1 - 2022-01-18
--------------------------

* Modify the format output by the debug option `--debug-qr` to be more human
  readable (`--debug-dns` output is left unchanged).
* Fix 2 minor bugs where an incorrect start time could be written to the CDNS
  file, resulting in a negative file duration.
* Documentation: correct the dependency list.
* Fix build issue when using `configure --disable-pseudo-anonymisation`. Thanks
  Sean Burford for reporting this.
* Add example docker image as a submodule in `contrib/dns-stats-docker`. Thanks 
  to Sean Burford for providing this.

Version 1.2.1-beta2 - 2021-09-23
--------------------------
* Bump the private version because schema extended with new stats.
* Add new stats to C-DNS: sniffer drops, matcher drops and sampling discards,
  and 3 libpcap stats. The libpcap stats should not be considered reliable and 
  provided for information only. 
* Fix file durations for files with more than one C-DNS block in them so high
  traffic rates can be correctly calculated from the statistics.
* Constrain size of matcher queue to reduce memory consumption when 
  dropping/sampling.
* Add `-D` option (--relaxed-mode). With this option a warning (not an error) is 
  issued for unrecognized command line and config file options. 

Version 1.2.1-beta1 - 2021-08-23
--------------------------

* Change behaviour of internal sniffer channel when overloaded to better
  report and manage dropping/sampling of packets
  * This fixes a bug where the 'Total Packets processed' statistic did not
    include any packets dropped during overload
* Improve `log-interval` statistics and packet drop logging
* EXPERIMENTAL: New sampling mode option (disabled by default)
  * sampling can be enabled at a specified rate for a specified time
    when packet drops exceed a specified threshold (see config options)

Version 1.2.0 - 2021-05-07
--------------------------

* Fix build issue when using --disable-dnstap.
* Add KNOWN ISSUE about the observed performance on VMs being much lower than
  expected, which is under investigation.
* Minor documentation updates.

Version 1.2.0-rc1 - 2021-04-19
------------------------------

* Get revised signal handling building on Mac as well as Linux and FreeBSD.
* Correct stats reporting processed message count to RFC8618. Retain
  total packet count as compactor-specific item.
* Minor test and documentation updates.

Version 1.2.0-beta4 - 2021-04-12
--------------------------------

* Add raw packet count and out of order count to statistics when
  collecting through DNSTAP. Also optionally periodically log statistics
  during collection as with PCAP.
* Revise signal handling for better reliability with DNSTAP.
* Catch malformed packets in DNSTAP collection and add count to statistics.
* If configured service address does not exist on any interface
  log a warning not an error.

Version 1.2.0-beta3 - 2021-03-30
--------------------------------

* Add DNSTAP options to sample config file.

Version 1.2.0-beta2 - 2021-03-25
--------------------------------

* Doxygen updates.

--------------------------------

* Add custom field of collection start time to block and to info file.
  File duration in info file is now end-start time.
* Add capture from DNSTAP, either over Unix socket or from file.

Version 1.1.0 - 2020-12-09
--------------------------

* No change from ~rc1.

Version 1.0.0-beta1 - 2019-09-20
--------------------------------

* Supports C-DNS as described in RFC8618.
** compactor writes only C-DNS 1.0 format.
** inspector reads C-DNS 1.0 and all previously supported draft formats.
* New fine-grained selection of data stored in C-DNS via excluded_fields file.
** Previous section 'include' settings are deprecated,
   and may only be used if excluded_fields file is not specified.
** Default values may be supplied to inspector for individual items of data not
   present in the C-DNS file. A complete set of defaults must be supplied
   when outputting PCAP.
* inspector command line options --info-only and --report-only are
  deprecated, and replaced with --no-info and --no-output.
* Added template items query_response_query_has_no_question
  and  query_response_response_has_no_question. Item
  query_response_query_has_question is deprecated.
* Addresses stored in C-DNS files may be stored only to a given prefix
  length, potentially saving storage space.
